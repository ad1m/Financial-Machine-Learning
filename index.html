    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is arguably one of the hottest and most exciting fields of study, making huge impacts and advancements across many industries and product lines. Machine learning systems are helping organizations accomplish complex tasks in a seamingly easy manner as these systems learn to understand, predict, adapt, and operate on thier own. They can injest large volumes of data at a given time, impossible for the human brain, learn and extract complex patterns from this data, and make inference and predictions that can adapt to changing environments. Companies and research institutes all around the world are leveraging machine learning such as  </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Amazon</b> - Offering personalised recommendations based on previous purchases or activity.</li>
    <li><b>Apple</b> - Siri uses machine learning for voice recognition as part of the virtual assistant feature on the iPhone.</li>
    <li><b>Facebook</b> - Friends are automatically tagged in pictures through a machine learning system that was built for facial recognition.</li>
    <li><b>Google</b> - Google Maps analyzes the speed of traffic through locations and suggests alternative routes all through the use of machine learning.</li>
    <li><b>Paypal</b> - Customer data is analyzed through machine learning systems to determine fradulent transactions</li>
    <li><b>Two Sigma</b> - Algorithmic trading systems are employing machine learning tactics to trade stocks among other derivatives at high frequency rates.</li>
    <li><b>Uber</b> - Rider pickup times use machine learning systems to determine arrival times</li>
    <li><b>Wealthfront</b> - "Robo-Advisor" sytems calibrate financial portfolios to the goals and risk tolerance of the user for active portfolio management.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Machine learning is a technology that is disrupting every industry, especially finance. Hedge funds are using machine learning systems to build high frequency trading algorithms, wealth management firms are creating "Robo-Advisors" to optimize client portfolios, financial technology firms are selling news analysis software to better understand public sentiment relating to market direction, and many more. It is a very exciting time for machine learning and as it relates to finance, this technology will transform how everyone invests.</p>
    <p>To understand how machine learning can be used in finance there are a few key fields that should be understood: Mathematics, Computer Science, and Finance. The goal of this book is to expose the reader to these three fields such that they can apply machine learning methods to build quantitative financial systems. To follow this book, a high level of experience is not needed in any of the above fields. We will navigate these fields and see how they work together so that we can apply machine learning in finance.</p>

    <p class="pullquote">These new devices are radically transforming what is possible in digital visual design and this has radical implications for digital typography. </p>
    <p>The death of the pixel leaves you with a flowing, magazine-quality canvas to design for. A canvas where curves are curves, not ugly pixel approximations of curves. A canvas that begins to blur the line between what we consider to be real and what we consider to be virtual.</p>
    <p>It wasn't too long ago that there was one set of rules for use of type on print and use of type on screen. Now that we have screens that are essentially print quality, we have to reevaluate these conventions.</p>
    <p> Web sites are transforming from boring fields of Arial to embrace the gamut of typographical possibilities offered by web fonts. Web fonts, combined with the style and layout options presented by the creative use of CSS and JavaScript offer a new world of typographic opportunity on the web. </p>
    <h2>Emotional Typography</h2>
    <p>Web fonts allow for a wider palette of typefaces which can provide far more quirkiness and personality.</p>
    <p>The challenge is to help people understand this. The classics such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana or Tahoma are engrained as fonts you will always expect to see; readers aren't used to seeing type choices beyond these usual suspects.</p>
    <p>The majority of screen graphics are done with JPGs that don't scale from the regular screens to retina screens. Now if you have these new type choices as web fonts, you have a scalable version of this which you can use, providing endless possibilities.</p>
    <h2>Technical Advantages</h2>
    <p>Think of this as adapting your tone of voice to the type of person or situation you are in. If you were being given a medical diagnosis the tone would not be fun or light-hearted. In contrast talking colloquially to a close friend could be the opposite of this.</p>
    <p>Web fonts allow you to have this kind of razor-sharp efficiency and elegance in design whilst at the same time avoiding the need for adding additional page graphics, which in turn add load time, decrease workflow performance and risk breaking across screen dimensions and device situations.</p>
